# Program Objective : Use of dplyr package

## ------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Uncomment the install lines if the package has not
## been installed on your computer.
#install.packages("nycflights13", dependencies = TRUE)
#install.packages("dplyr", dependencies = TRUE)
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

### this is just showing the last line of video
starwars[1:10,] %>%
  select(name, species) %>%
  mutate(isDroidFlag = 
           ifelse(species == "Droid", TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  summarize(countDroids = sum(isDroidFlag, na.rm = TRUE),
            pctDroids = mean(isDroidFlag, na.rm = TRUE))
            

## Now demo dplyr functionality with data from nycflights13
## Show the dataframe in the RStudio environment
flights = flights

## just fyi, there are lots of datasets already in R
data()

## ------------------------------------------------------------------------
filter(flights, day == 1, month == 1)


####{Class Exercise:} Create a new data frame called uaFlights that finds all flights where the carrier was United Airlines.



## ------------------------------------------------------------------------
arrange(flights, year, month, day)

## ------------------------------------------------------------------------
arrange(flights, desc(arr_delay))

## ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Select columns by name
select(flights, year, month, day)

# Select all columns between year and day (inclusive)
select(flights, year:day)

# Select all columns except those from year to day (inclusive)
select(flights, -(year:day))

## ------------------------------------------------------------------------  get unique row values
select(flights, tailnum) %>% distinct()

####{Class Exercise:} In a separate script, create a new data frame called routes that consists of two columns which contain all combinations of flight origin and flight destination in the original dataset.  How many unique routes are there?




## ------------------------------------------------------------------------
flightSpeedDF = select(flights, distance, air_time)
mutate(flightSpeedDF,
  speed = distance / air_time * 60)

## ------------------------------------------------------------------------
summarise(flights,
  delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

## ------------------------------------------------------------------------
## creater new dataframe that is organized by groups
destinations = group_by(flights, dest)
destDF = summarise(destinations,
  planes = n_distinct(tailnum), #unique planes
  flights = n() # number of flights
)
destDF

####{Class Exercise:} In a separate script, create a new data frame called sortDestDF that orders (i.e. arranges the destDF dataframe in descending order of popularity - i.e. number of flights from NYC to that destination) to discover the most popular places people from New York City fly to.




## ------------------------------------------------------------------------
lightSpeedDF = select(flights, distance, air_time, dest)
lightSpeedDF2 = mutate(lightSpeedDF,
  speed = distance / air_time * 60)
lightSpeedDF3 = group_by(lightSpeedDF2, dest)
lightSpeedDF4 = summarize(lightSpeedDF3, avgSpeed = mean(speed, na.rm = TRUE))
arrange(lightSpeedDF4, desc(avgSpeed))


##The above is challenging code to read.
## Here is the nice chained version using the chaining
## operator (i.e. %>%, aka pipe, aka "then")
flights %>%
  select(distance, air_time, dest) %>%
  mutate(speed = distance / air_time * 60) %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(avgSpeed = mean(speed, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avgSpeed))

####{Class Exercise:} In a separate script, use the chaining operator, %>%, to find which of the New York City airports experience the highest average departure delay.
